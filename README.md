# NFL_contact_detection
## Introduction
This project is developed to propose solution for kaggle competition problem https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-player-contact-detection. 
The goal of the competition is to detect contact between any 2 players and between any player and the ground at every given video frame.
More details about the competition and available data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-player-contact-detection.
## Project setup
1. Download the repo `git clone https://github.com/morales-cmd/NFL_contact_detection.git`
2. Create python venv `python -m venv ./venv`
3. Activate venv `source venv/bin/activate` or `source venv/Scripts/activate` depending on the OS
4. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Data used in the project is too heavy for github repository. Download .zip with data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-player-contact-detection/data, extract it, rename folder to "data", so that it looks like this:

6. You can now run code from notebooks. Make sure your notebooks are using created venv. If you're using VS code (with downloaded extension for jupyter notebook), it can be set here:
